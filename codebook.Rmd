The specific actions for the R script is as follows:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


This code book will detail the steps in the code and explain how the result was accomplished. 

**This data is tidy because each observation for each subject for each activity has it's own row.**

The enviroment requires the installation and proper functioning of the dplyr and tidyr packages.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#install.packages("tidyr")
#install.packages("dplyr")
```

Data has been downloaded and is stored on my local drive. The download and unzipping process is not detailed here.
The files are:
##Data files, decimal data type
*X_test.txt
*X_train.txt 

##Header labels for data files
*features.txt

##Key and label for activities
*activity_labels.txt

##Data for activites
*y_test.txt
*y_train.txt

##Subject id data
*subject_train.txt
*subject_test.txt

The following fields have been taken from the original set of 561 availible fields and are summarized in the final tidy data output.

All fields are decimal fields except for the activity and subjectLabels fields. Those two are character and numeric factors respectively.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
