The specific actions for the R script is as follows:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


This code book will detail the steps in the code and explain how the result was accomplished. 

**This data is tidy because each observation for each subject for each activity has it's own row.**

The enviroment requires the installation and proper functioning of the dplyr and tidyr packages.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#install.packages("tidyr")
#install.packages("dplyr")
```

Data has been downloaded and is stored on my local drive. The download and unzipping process is not detailed here.
The files are:
##Data files, decimal data type
*X_test.txt 
*X_train.txt 

##Header labels for data files
*features.txt

##Key and label for activities
*activity_labels.txt

##Data for activites
*y_test.txt
*y_train.txt

##Subject id data
*subject_train.txt
*subject_test.txt

```{r, echo=FALSE}
test_file <- "C:/Users/bever/Documents/R/Rscripts/CleaningData/UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt"
train_file <- "C:/Users/bever/Documents/R/Rscripts/CleaningData/UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt"
h_file <- "C:/Users/bever/Documents/R/Rscripts/CleaningData/UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt"
activity_lbl <- "C:/Users/bever/Documents/R/Rscripts/CleaningData/UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt"


ytest_file <- "C:/Users/bever/Documents/R/Rscripts/CleaningData/UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt"
ytrain_file <- "C:/Users/bever/Documents/R/Rscripts/CleaningData/UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt"

subject_test_file <- "C:/Users/bever/Documents/R/Rscripts/CleaningData/UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt"
subject_train_file <- "C:/Users/bever/Documents/R/Rscripts/CleaningData/UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt"
```
They fit together as follows:
![](https://github.com/beverand/ProgrammingAssignment-TidyData/blob/master/Drawing1.jpg)

The files are read in without headers because they are separate. Subject (*subj_train*/*subj_test*), activity (*activities*) and the *headers* are read in as character.
Data (*trainX*,*testX*,*trainy*,*testy*) is read in a numeric as R defaults to when it knows the type.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#read in all files
trainX<- fread(train_file, header=FALSE)
testX<-fread(test_file, header = FALSE)
trainy<- fread(ytrain_file, header=FALSE)
testy<-fread(ytest_file, header = FALSE)
activities <-fread(activity_lbl,header=FALSE, stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
subj_train <- fread(subject_train_file, header = FALSE,colClasses = 'character', stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
subj_test<- fread(subject_test_file, header = FALSE,colClasses = 'character', stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
headers<-fread(h_file)
```


The header file is manipulated to add the activity and subject labels to the set of labels from features.txt
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#combine test and training file
headers<-rbind(headers, list(562, "activityLabels"))
headers<-rbind(headers, list(563, "subjectLabels"))
```

The activity and subject labels are added to the columns for those respective fields so that errors related to two columns having the same name (V1) can be avoided.
The activity label is the same for the activity number from the activity data in the test/train_y files and the numeric key in the activity labels file. This will allow for them to be joined later on.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
colnames(testy)<- "activityLabels"
colnames(trainy)<- "activityLabels"
colnames(activities)<-c("activityLabels", "activity")
colnames(subj_test)<- "subjectLabels"
colnames(subj_train)<- "subjectLabels"
```


The data can now be bound together for each set without error, because of the labeling done above.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
testX <-cbind(testX, testy, subj_test)
trainX <-cbind(trainX, trainy, subj_train)
```


To get all of the mean and standard devation columns, the grepl function is used to search the headers for the words mean, std or Labels. arr.ind = TRUE gives us just the indexes. Thus, *selectedCols* is a vector of numbers. The data is also put into a list with the all of the actual character name values, this is stored in *h* and will be used to label our columns on the final dataset. *h* is then further modified to be limited to just the selected columns
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#get indexes for all mean and standard devation columns
selectedCols <-which(headers[, grepl("mean|std|Labels", headers$V2)], arr.ind = TRUE)

#turn data frame into header list
h<-unlist(select(headers, V2), use.names = FALSE)

#use find the mean, standard devation and label columns then assign them as colname 
h<-subset(h, h %in% grep("mean|std|Labels", h, value = TRUE))
```

The test and train data sets are combined here into the variable *combined*.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#combine test and training sets
combined<-rbind(testX,trainX)
```

The selected columns are then put into the *selectedData* variable and then *h* is put into the column names.
*selectedData_final* has the activity labels merged into it from the activities variable (this data is 1 WALKING, for example).The actual numeric factor column is no longer necessary, so it is removed from this cut of the data.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#select those columns from the combined data set
selectedData<-select(combined, selectedCols)
colnames(selectedData) <- h

selectedData_final <- merge(selectedData, activities, by.x="activityLabels", by.y="activityLabels")

#remove the activity labels numeric column 
selectedData_final[,activityLabels:=NULL]
```


Finally the tidy dataset is returned in *out_final* which consists of the mean for each subject by activity with the nulls removed.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#final summary
out_final <-selectedData_final[, lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm=TRUE), by=c('subjectLabels',"activity") ]
```

The following fields have been taken from the original set of 561 availible fields and are summarized in the final tidy data output.

All fields are decimal fields except for the activity and subjectLabels fields. Those two are character and numeric factors respectively.
